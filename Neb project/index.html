				<p class="lore-c"> The Black Mesa Corporation were one of the leading scientific companies in old America. By the start of the third millennia, they had established themselves as the paragons of progress in the realms of research. Eager to reap the fruits of their work, many governments and private companies alike established numerous contracts with Black Mesa, funding the countless projects of the company’s restless minds, driving their research forth at an unprecedented degree.
					This thirst for knowledge did not go unnoticed.

A mysterious third party came into contact with the company’s director, Wallace Breen. Represented by a single man, they offered their assistance at little to no cost. Soon enough, however, this assistance has proven to be less than altruistic in nature. It was this very “assistance” that led Black Mesa to delving into fields that proved more and more dangerous as time went on, touching subjects very few would consider ethical. By the start of the following decade, the employees of Black Mesa Research Facility were knee-deep in matters they clearly should have never touched: weapons of unfathomable power, creatures from outside our realm, tools to warp reality itself, and, most importantly, the alien world we now know as Xen.

Strangely, as the research approached its peak, things began to go wrong. One after another, issues arose, only to be dismissed by the Director regardless of their severity. In little time the facility reached a near critical condition as the problems became impossible to ignore, with new failures appearing almost daily as the studies continued. However, those malfunctions were not the only thing that became more frequent. With each new issue, his presence within the facility grew, and with it, grew the value of his demands and offerings.

All of it culminated on what seemed like a typical week in early May, when Breen was met with an offer he could not allow himself to refuse - an item he and his colleagues had sought after for the past several years - a rare sample of a material one could only obtain in the darkest corners of the border world. However, as ambitious as the scientists may have been about the upcoming experiment, the Director was well informed of the true goal of the experiment.

And then it happened. The Resonance Cascade. </p>

			<p class="lore-c"> Many see it as the day that started our current world, but it is a sad truth that it was in the making for many years by forces unfathomable to us. A matter of time. The gears have been in motion for far too long for anyone to have stopped it.

On that day reality tore itself open, spilling the chaos of its innards onto planet Earth as portals to the borderworld opened and closed across the globe, releasing its flora and fauna to wreak havoc in every part of the world, changing the order of nature forever. A state of National Emergency was declared in the America, a sentiment soon shared by the rest of the countries.

Well prepared for the coming crisis, Breen, with the aid of his mysterious benefactor, had warned the Military of the possible troubles, ensuring swift response as he fled to the North. But it was done not out of genuine care for the safety of his men, but rather out of desire to preserve himself in the future. Having realized those possessing full knowledge of what had led to this day will go against him, the Director planned to have all of his employees slaughtered like animals before having the entire facility wiped off the face of the Earth with a Nuclear Strike, burying the secrets of the past with those that helped create them.

But despite Breen’s best efforts, a handful of people managed to survive, thanks in no small part to the aforementioned benefactor, who, away from the Director’s eyes, presented each survivor with a deal. And while most have reluctantly agreed, some said no, vanishing without a trace, never to be seen again.

The rest of the world did not share their luck. Over the following months everything descended into chaos: countries fell and rose anew like in the days of old. Ecosystems reaching biological insanity through Xenian interference. Literal mountains teleported in and out of existence, through space and time. People, scared of the growing threats of the outside world, fled to the cities in desperate hopes of finding safety, only to be met with starvation and cold nights on the streets while the armies of the world fought both each other and the countless hordes of beasts from the darkest depths of cosmos.

Ironically, this new world of chaos was not meant to last.</p>

			<p class="lore-c"> A mysterious Cross-Universal Group known as the Combine had picked up on the Resonance. An Empire beyond comprehension, they had the resources to arrange an invasion in mere weeks, controlling the energy of the portals themselves to let themselves pass from Xen to Earth when the time came to deploy. They threw mile-tall towers from the sky, plunging them into the earth before opening the gates to let their countless forces attack, instantly overwhelming our weakened armies.

Seven hours. All it took for us to be defeated. Once just a couple of words; now - a symbol echoing through every living man’s mind. A reminder of humanity’s single defeat at the face of an enemy so incomprehensible in scale and power it will echo through generations, never to be forgotten again. Crushing not only in its physical consequences but in the message it carried. We, the humans, once thought ourselves to be the sole conquerors of the realm, the greatest the world had to offer. Our defeat, symbolic as it may be, was the embodiment of our own arrogance backfiring at us.

As disastrous as it may have been, our defeat was not the end of us. It was a beginning of a new era, one marked by two forces opposed to each other locked in a never-ending cycle of conflict, corruption and mutual resistance.

Although not everyone agreed to surrender after the war, the establishment of the Earth’s occupation was swift and pragmatic. The Combine, first thought to be the destroyers of mankind, instead chose to make use of us. Some view it as slavery, but many considered it to be something entirely different.

After the initial slaughter that followed the Seven Hour War, things started going in a direction different from before. Cities were re-established and some semblance of order and civilization - even if transformed into an authoritarian regime - seemed to have returned, spearheaded by none other than Wallace Breen himself - a man who sold the world in exchange for unfathomable power in the servitude of those we now know as Our Benefactors.

At first, many resisted. A great insurgency sparked at the heart of Europe, lead by the few survivors of Black Mesa, with the man known as Eli Vance as their leader. Bolstered by their knowledge of the extraterrestrial, it seemed like the scientists were on the verge of a breakthrough that would allow them to force the Combine out of the earth, but… They didn’t.

Some underlings failed to keep their mouths shut, and, soon enough, the entire operation was compromised, leading to a great attack on Black Mesa East. Eli Vance - the man who kept the group together, was killed in the process, leaving his comrades fleeing for their lives or, as was the case with those less fortunate, recruited by Breen himself to join his cause.

			<p class="lore-c"> With what he deemed to be the greatest threat to his plan dealt with, Breen turned his eyes to the stars as he thought of ways he could bargain with the Combine to benefit both himself and humanity. It was a time of great operations on global scale. Research of teleportation, the Search for the Mystical ships of the North, the Study of Xen’s mystical inhabitants.

Yet, as with many great beginnings of our time, very little came out of it.

With the Combine realizing Humanity could offer very little but themselves, they, in a bizarre twist of fate, chose to ease their grip on the newly discovered world, with most of its overseers handing even greater power to Breen before growing dormant, awaiting further developments. What was meant to become a great rape of our resources or a complete assimilation became a halfway-uninterested occupation, maintained for the sole purpose of confirming its own existence. The next step in the evolution of our species promised by “our Benefactors” seemed to have been pushed back into obscurity, leaving Earth… Directionless. Without a point. Akin to a tiny plot of land in an Unknown sea with a great Empire’s flag waving for no one to see.

Without an iron fist to rule over him, Breen, in a moment of disappointment and arrogance, chose to split Earth into Sectors, giving them resemblance of the Countries of Old, creating the Great Council - an assembly of Sector Administrators to aid him in ruling his Worldwide Empire.

As time went on, this brave new world seemed to have become mundane. The future became the present, and humanity grew accustomed to the antics of our times. The relocations, insurgencies, aliens. All of it became the norm. And without the Overseers to maintain the standards, Sectors now used their diversified power not only to combat the rebellion, but also against one another. Soon, the once pristine order of the Universal Union became corrupted with Human touch, tainted by a blanket of mankind’s worst qualities, washing off what little benevolence the Combine’s mysterious goals may have had. Corruption, intrigue and lies now flow through its veins, serving as the lifeblood of the regimes across the world.

But it doesn’t concern you. Not as much as you wish it did. As grim as the world around you may seem, you’re just a regular person living a regular life. The tyrannical despots and failing democracies seem so distant behind the window of the comfort your City has given you. For all you know, half of your knowledge on the current state of things may be nothing more than a bunch of legends made up by the gossipers in your district.

You’re sitting in a camp, relocated from the comfort of your city to fill the demographic gap in a recently recovered Urban Centre somewhere in the East of Europe. You look around yourself, inspecting the Prison that has been hastily converted to temporarily house Refugees and Cross-sector commuters. It’s getting cold.

The Year is 2025, and, as much as you hate to admit it, today feels weird. Today feels new.</p>
